### New Developer Onboarding
📖 **See [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive setup and development instructions.**

## Next Steps

This foundation is ready for backend integration with the designed architecture:

### 🏗️ Backend Architecture Design
The complete backend design is documented in [`docs/`](./docs/) including:

- **[Backend Architecture](./docs/backend-architecture.md)**: Scalable multi-tenant SaaS architecture using Azure Functions
- **[API Design](./docs/backend-api-design.md)**: RESTful API specification with authentication and endpoints
- **[SPFx Communication](./docs/spfx-backend-communication.md)**: Integration patterns between frontend and backend
- **[User Journey](./docs/user-journey.md)**: Marketplace buyer onboarding and success metrics

### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Backend Development**: Implement Azure Functions API based on the [architecture design](./docs/backend-architecture.md)
2. **SPFx Integration**: Replace MockDataService using the [communication patterns](./docs/spfx-backend-communication.md)
3. **User Management**: Implement detailed user management functionality with backend API
4. **Library Operations**: Add real add/remove library capabilities through backend services
5. **Marketplace Launch**: Deploy following the [user journey](./docs/user-journey.md) specifications
4. **Permissions Management**: Implement permission level changes
5. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk user management features

## Technology Stack
